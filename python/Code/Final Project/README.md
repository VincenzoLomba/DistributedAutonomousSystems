### Implementations of the G.T.M. *and* of a distributed aggregative optimization problem for a multi-agent system (in ROS2)
Note also that this repository contains the [code](https://github.com/VincenzoLomba/DistributedAutonomousSystems/tree/master/python/Code/Final%20Project) related to the development both of an implementation of the Gradient Tracking Method (testing it and useing it to solve cooperative multi-robot target localization problems) *and* of the implementation a multi-robot (AKA multi-agent) aggregative optimization algorithm with visualization and animation capabilities (also using [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) to simulate the multi-robot (AKA multi-agent) aggregative optimization algorithm in a truly distributed system).
