### A Simple DAS Project: Implementations of the G.T.M. *and* a Distributed Aggregative Optimization Problem for a Multi-Agent System (in ROS2)

This folder contains all the code related to the development of the DAS Project, created by following the guidelines provided in the assignment document: [Project Assignment 2K25](https://github.com/VincenzoLomba/DistributedAutonomousSystems/blob/master/python/Code/Final%20Project/Assignement/Project%20Assignment%202K25.pdf).  

It includes three main tasks:

- [**Task 1**][task1]: Implementation of a Gradient Tracking Method (G.T.M.), tested and then used to solve cooperative multi-robot target localization problems.
- [**Task 2.1**][task21]: Implementation of a multi-robot (i.e., multi-agent) aggregative optimization algorithm with visualization and animation capabilities.
- [**Task 2.2**][task22]: The same as Task 2.1, but implemented using [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html).

[task1]: https://github.com/VincenzoLomba/DistributedAutonomousSystems/tree/master/python/Code/Final%20Project/Task1
[task21]: https://github.com/VincenzoLomba/DistributedAutonomousSystems/tree/master/python/Code/Final%20Project/Task2.1
[task22]: https://github.com/VincenzoLomba/DistributedAutonomousSystems/tree/master/python/Code/Final%20Project/Task2.2%20(at%2010-07-2025)
