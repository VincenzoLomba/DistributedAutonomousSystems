# Distributed Autonomous Systems Teaching

This repository contains all the code developed during the lessons of [Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.unibo.it/en/study/phd-professional-masters-specialisation-schools-and-other-programmes/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2024/454490),  
a course within the [Automation Engineering degree program](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/AutomationEngineering) at [Alma Mater Studiorum – University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage).  
<br/>
All the code is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/about/). Projects and exercises are developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the preferred editor.

### Implementations of the G.T.M. *and* a Distributed Aggregative Optimization Problem for a Multi-Agent System (in ROS2)

This repository also includes the [code](https://github.com/VincenzoLomba/DistributedAutonomousSystems/tree/master/python/Code/Final%20Project) developed for the DAS Final Project, which consists of:

- An implementation of the **Gradient Tracking Method (G.T.M.)**, tested and applied to a cooperative multi-robot target localization problem.
- An implementation of a **multi-robot (i.e., multi-agent) aggregative optimization algorithm**, with full visualization and animation capabilities.
- A ROS2-based version of the above optimization algorithm, using [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) to simulate a truly distributed system.
