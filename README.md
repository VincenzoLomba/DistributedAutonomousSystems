# Distributed Autonomous Systems Teaching

This repository contains all the code developed during lessions of [Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.unibo.it/en/study/phd-professional-masters-specialisation-schools-and-other-programmes/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2024/454490),
which is a teaching of [Automation Engeneering's degree](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/AutomationEngineering) ([Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage)).<br/>
<br/>
All the code is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/about/). All projects and exercises are developed using [VIsual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor.

### Implementations of the G.T.M. *and* of a distributed aggregative optimization problem for a multi-agent system (in ROS2)
Note also that this repository contains the [code](https://github.com/VincenzoLomba/DistributedAutonomousSystems/tree/master/python/Code/Final%20Project) related to the development both of an implementation of the Gradient Tracking Method (testing it and useing it to solve cooperative multi-robot target localization problems) *and* of the implementation a multi-robot (AKA multi-agent) aggregative optimization algorithm with visualization and animation capabilities (also using [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) to simulate the multi-robot (AKA multi-agent) aggregative optimization algorithm in a truly distributed system).
